      <description>PyTorch Pytorch is an open source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment.
Regression Problem Example Boston Housing Dataset I have used the Boston housing dataset as it is one of the basic and beginner friendly dataset on Kaggle
Python Implementation The implementation creates a simple neural network using pytorch and compares with a baseline linear regression model.
Learnings Some key lessons learnt are to start with simple datasets and compare with baseline model to see the difference of using a non linear type model.</description>

      <description>Customer Data Integration The first step even before you can begin to apply data science to a problem consists of loading customer data into your system. Although, trivial when you are doing a one off batch load/read from files or databases. It can quickly become a non-trivial task when data updates often, leading to many data refreshes.
To resolve this problem, data science systems use what are known as data loader/integration platforms.</description>
