      <description>A Definitive Complied Guide for Bulk Inserts to Postgres Taken from a stackoverflow answer as below1 (Note that this answer is about bulk-loading data into an existing DB or to create a new one. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested DB restore performance with pg_restore or psql execution of pg_dump output, much of this doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply since pg_dump and pg_restore already do things like creating triggers and indexes after it finishes a schema+data restore).</description>

      <description>PyTorch Pytorch is an open source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment.&#xA;Regression Problem Example Boston Housing Dataset I have used the Boston housing dataset as it is one of the basic and beginner friendly dataset on Kaggle&#xA;Python Implementation The implementation creates a simple neural network using pytorch and compares with a baseline linear regression model.&#xA;Learnings Some key lessons learnt are to start with simple datasets and compare with baseline model to see the difference of using a non linear type model.</description>

      <description>Customer Data Integration The first step even before you can begin to apply data science to a problem, consists of loading customer data into your system. Although, trivial when you are doing a one off batch load/read from files or databases. It can quickly become a non-trivial task when data updates often, leading to many data refreshes.&#xA;To resolve this problem, data science systems use what are known as data loader/integration platforms.</description>
