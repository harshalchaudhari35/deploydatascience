[Banana ML](https://banana.dev) : A Revolutionary Tool for Cheap and Faster ML Inference

Data science and machine learning are quickly becoming essential tools for businesses across the world. The increasing demand for data-driven solutions and applications has created a need for tools that can help developers build cheaper and faster. 

What is Banana ML?
-------
Enter Banana ML: a powerful, easy-to-use platform for building modern data science applications faster.

Banana ML is an open source machine learning platform built for developers. It provides a simple graphical interface for creating custom machine learning models and deploying them in the cloud. Banana ML also offers a wide range of pre-built machine learning models and templates that can be used to quickly build data science applications.

Key Features
---------
One of the key advantages of using Banana ML is its ability to **scale machine learning inference and training on serverless GPUs.** By leveraging serverless GPUs, Banana ML allows developers to build and deploy machine learning models on the cloud without having to manage any hardware or software. This makes it easier and faster to develop data science applications.

Being serverless means that you are ***only paying for the time you need to run the inference of your model***, which dramatically reduces cost for applications which have spiky and intermittent load. This is essential when you are a startup or just starting to build out your lean MVP.

Another great feature of Banana ML is its custom model deployment capabilities, which means developers can easily deploy their own multiple models to the cloud and manage them through the Banana ML dashboard. Making it easy to update models and deploy them in production.
